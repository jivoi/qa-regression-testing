udisks has extensive tests that are _not_ run at build time.

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep udisks2
sudo apt-get install devscripts fakeroot libatasmart-bin lvm2 kpartx dmeventd

apt-get source udisks2
Go into the source directory, and build with "debuild".

Once finished building, run the tests:
--------------------------------------

sudo src/tests/integration-tests (tests from source tree)

mv src/udisksd src/udisksd.old
sudo src/tests/integration-tests (tests system udisks2)

i386 note:
----------
On i386, the tests may fail immediately with a "cannot allocate memory"
error when trying to modprobe the scsi_debug module. If this happens, the
systems needs to be rebooted with "vmalloc=300M" added to the kernel boot
command line.
