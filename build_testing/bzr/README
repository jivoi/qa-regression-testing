It is easy to do bzr tests:

$ sudo apt-get install bzr python-testtools
$ bzr selftest --no-plugins

This will take roughly 30-45 minutes to run on regular hardware.
As of maverick, many tests still fail.

It will write a .bzr.log file with details of failures, which
can be compared to the results/bzr/ directory.
