logrotate has a small test suite in the "test" directory.
In theory, the QRT test should reproduce all the tests from the test
directory.

This is how to run it anyway:

In a schroot, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep logrotate

Go into the source directory, and build with "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot".

Once finished building, run the tests:

make test

All tests should pass.
