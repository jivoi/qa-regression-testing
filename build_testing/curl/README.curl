CURL TESTING
------------
During build, curl runs its test suite. Comparing the build logs with the
previous release should be sufficient to notice any regressions.

The test suite in the build logs must be checked thoroughly, as a recent security
update introduced a regression.

New security patches should not be added at the end of the patches/series file
or they won't get applied, as debian/rules applies patches based on name. See
debian/rules file for more information and make sure patches get applied in the
build logs.

On gutsy, test 500 fails during the gnutls build. It appears to be timing
dependant, as building it manually in a schroot or building it without clearing
out the env variables makes it test successfully. Building on the build servers
doesn't show this issue.

Do not run multiple curl builds in parallel; the test infrastructure from one
run will interfere with the tests in another build, causing needless log
differences.

Tests known to be troublesome:

Raring 518 537
Quantal 518 537
Precise -none-
Oneiric -none-
Lucid -skips tests-
Hardy -no fails, but skips some tests-

-------------------------------
To manually run the test suite:
-------------------------------

sudo apt-get build-dep curl
sudo apt-get install devscript
apt-get source curl
cd curl*
./configure
make
make test

Can run individual tests by doing:
cd tests
./runtests.pl 31 (to run 31 for example)
