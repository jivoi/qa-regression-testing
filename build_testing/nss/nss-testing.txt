NSS has a test suite that is _not_ run at build time.

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep nss
sudo apt-get install devscripts fakeroot

Make sure /etc/hosts has the following:
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.localdomain

Go into the source directory, and build with "debuild".

Once finished building, go into the test directory, and perform a fix to
get the proper paths:

cd mozilla/security/nss/tests/
sed -i s/OBJDIR=.*$/OBJDIR=\"\"/ common/init.sh

Now, run the tests:

HOST=localhost DOMSUF=localdomain ./all.sh
