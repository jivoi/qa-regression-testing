New security patches should not be added at the end of the patches/00list file
or they won't be applied. Packages have two patches at the end of 00list
that are needed for the dhcp ldap packages. These ldap packages are built
first, then the patches are rolled back and the non-ldap (default) dhcp
packages are built. As such, patches *must* be listed before these ldap
patches for the patches to be applied to all builds. See debian/rules for
more information.
