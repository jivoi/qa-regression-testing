Build Testing
-------------
To get this to work, need to add to debian/rules in the configure line:
--enable-socket-wrapper \

Then build:
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

Then run the test:
cd source
sudo make test  (may want to run as non-root first, since it builds programs.
                if you do it will fail all the tests, but after which can run
                under sudo)


Dapper and Edgy-- died when building.  Need to adjust source Makefile* to have:
...
MNT_OBJ = client/smbmnt.o lib/replace.o $(VERSION_OBJ) $(SNPRINTF_OBJ) $(SOCKET_WRAPPER_OBJ)
...
UMOUNT_OBJ = client/smbumount.o $(SOCKET_WRAPPER_OBJ)
...

Keep in mind edgy and dapper's testsuite is *very* limited
