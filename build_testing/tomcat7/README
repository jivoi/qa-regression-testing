https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tomcat7/+bug/1115053 attempted to
fix a large number of CVEs, however tomcat7 does not have the in build test
suite enabled until Ubuntu 12.10. The testsuite is quite useful and uncovered
a number of problems with the submitted patches.

These debdiffs enable a testsuite target for 11.10 and 12.04 LTS (not enabled
in the build) and should be enabled in the next security upload. See
README.source for details.

Once these are applied, running the testsuite is a manner of:
1. applying patches
2. as root in a chroot:
# apt-get build-dep tomcat7
# apt-get install junit4 libjstl1.1-java libjakarta-taglibs-standard-java
3. as a normal user in the same chroot:
$ debian/rules testsuite

Then comparing the files in output/build/logs/* with the tarballs in this
directory.

Note: Several tests are fail intermittently with 7.0.26 (12.04):
TEST-org.apache.catalina.tribes.group.TestGroupChannelMemberArrival.BIO.txt
TEST-org.apache.catalina.tribes.group.TestGroupChannelMemberArrival.NIO.txt
TEST-org.apache.catalina.comet.TestCometProcessor.NIO.txt
TEST-org.apache.catalina.connector.TestCoyoteAdapter.BIO.txt
