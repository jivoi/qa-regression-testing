No automated build tests.  There is a './test' directory, but it is not for
build testing per its README.

Thoughts
--------
* test apache2-mpm-worker, apache2-mpm-event, apache2-prefork, apache2-mpm-itk,
  apache2-mpm-perchild
* test the LAMP stack
* use upstream's perl-framework in combination with python unit testing


apache-mpm-itk
--------------
This is a universe package and has to be rebuilt everytime apache2 is update
(feisty through jaunty, inclusive) as it depends on a specific version of
apache2-common.

After building, verify with:
dpkg -I apache2-mpm-itk*deb


Perl-Framework
--------------
Can see:
http://httpd.apache.org/test/

svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/trunk/ httpd-test

Usage:
apt-get install libcrypt-ssleay-perl libdevel-corestack-perl libdevel-symdump-perl perl-modules perl libhtml-tagset-perl libhtml-parser-perl libwww-perl libipc-run3-perl libhttp-dav-perl

Depending on which server is being tested, need to do:
apt-get install apache2-prefork-dev apache2-mpm-prefork libapache2-mod-php5
apt-get install apache2-threaded-dev apache2-mpm-worker 
apt-get install apache2-threaded-dev apache2-mpm-itk (feisty and later, but a
	universe package and not from apache2 source)
apt-get install apache2-threaded-dev apache2-mpm-event (feisty and later, but
	broken on feisty and gutsy i386 (#187690))
apt-get install apache2-threaded-dev apache2-mpm-perchild (edgy, dapper)


** IMPORTANT **
Debian has a configuration format that perl-framework does not understand.
To get it to work need to:

$ sudo mv /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.old
$ sudo cp /etc/apache2/apache2.conf /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.old
$ sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/apache2.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
$ sudo sed -i 's,^Include /etc/apache2/httpd.conf,,' /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

Also, apxs2 on Debian doesn't support 'apxs2 -q PREFIX' properly, so need to
just hard code it (found with "grep -r PREFIX ./* |grep apxs | grep '.pm:'"):
$ cd httpd-test/perl-framework
$ sed -i "s,\$self->apxs('PREFIX'),'/usr'," Apache-Test/lib/Apache/TestConfigParse.pm

and if you ran 'make test' already, then need to do this:
$ sed -i "s,\$self->apxs('PREFIX'),'/usr'," blib/lib/Apache/TestConfigParse.pm


The nice thing with doing the above is that a2enmod will work as expected for
the tests.

perl ./Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/bin/apxs2
make test

Alternatively, can use:
./t/TEST

See perl-framework/README for more information.


If get this error:
[  error] configure() has failed:
Can't figure out what Apache server generation we are running at
/tmp/gutsy/httpd-test/perl-framework/Apache-Test/lib/Apache/TestServer.pm line
93.

Need to make sure you have apache2-threaded-dev or apache2-prefork-dev
installed.

Adding Modules
--------------
a2enmod include
perl ./Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/bin/apxs2
make test

Testing just one module (note that 'make test' needs to have run it at least
once):
./t/TEST ./t/modules/include.t


Enabling supported modules (on gutsy and feisty):
#!/bin/sh

for i in access alias asis auth_digest authn_anon autoindex cache cgi disk_cache dav dav_lock dav_fs deflate ext_filter filter auth_digest dir env expires headers imagemap include info negotiation proxy proxy_balancer proxy_connect proxy_ftp proxy_http rewrite setenvif ssl status vhost_alias
do
        a2enmod $i
done
/etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload


Enabled supported modules (on edgy and dapper):
#!/bin/sh

for i in asis auth_digest auth_anon cache cgi disk_cache dav dav_fs deflate expires ext_filter file_cache headers imap include info proxy proxy_connect proxy_ftp proxy_http rewrite ssl vhost_alias
do
        a2enmod $i
done
/etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload

case_filter and case_filter_in are experimental and not compiled.
