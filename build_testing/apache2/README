The excellent run_framework.sh script in this directory will perform all
the necessary magic to get the apache2 testing framework running.

Copy the contents of this directory to a VM running the desired release
and simply run the run_framwork.sh script. Errors printed on the console
for the script may be normal, check the output files in the directory to
see if the tests ran successfully.
