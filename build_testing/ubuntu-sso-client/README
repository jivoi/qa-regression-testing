ubuntu-sso-client has an excellent test suite that needs to be run manually.

In a VM:
- apt-get build-dep ubuntu-sso-client
- apt-get install ubuntuone-dev-tools python-mocker pep8 pylint xvfb
- apt-get install ubuntu-sso-client-qt python-qt4reactor (precise+)
- get the source:
  - original: apt-get source ubuntu-sso-client
  - patched: copy over source tree to VM
- enter source tree
- ./run-tests > /tmp/results.txt 2>&1
