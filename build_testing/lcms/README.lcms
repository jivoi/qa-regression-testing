lcms testing
------------

The tests need to be run manually in a chroot.

First build lcms with:
$ sudo apt-get update ; apt-get source lcms ; sudo apt-get build-dep lcms
$ cd lcms-<version>
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
$ cd testbed
$ make testcms
$ ./testcms > test.log

If you are running on jaunty+, the .icm profile files have been removed from
the dfsg packages, so you must copy them from a previous release, like
Intrepid into the current directory before running the test.
