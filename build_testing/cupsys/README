CUPS TESTING SUITE
------------------

Need this patch to allow 'make check' to work:

OTHER LEVELS
------------
In addition to 'make check', more thorough test can be run: 
0 - No testing, keep the scheduler running for me (all systems)
1 - Basic conformance test, no load testing (all systems)
2 - Basic conformance test, some load testing (minimum 256MB VM, 50MB disk)
3 - Basic conformance test, extreme load testing (minimum 1GB VM, 500MB disk)
4 - Basic conformance test, torture load testing (minimum 2GB VM, 1GB disk)

make check runs a 'level 1' test.

$ apt-get install openssl valgrind
$ cd test
$ ./run-stp-tests.sh

Note that valgrind did not work in the chroot.

I ran a level '3' test with requiring SSL (no valgrind) and had the following:

Hardy: 1 failure:
FAIL: 13 warning messages, expected 0.

Gutsy: same as make check

Feisty: same as make check

Edgy: same as make check

Dapper: has one less failure (!)


Ideas
-----
cupsys 1.3.7 has a much improved test suite-- perhaps it is possible to run it
against earlier releases. Note that it might need the EINTR fix pitti applied
to 1.3.7-1ubuntu1.

1.2 releases:
"test/ipptest.c:616: undefined reference to 
               `cupsDoIORequest'" -- meh (testing on 1.2.7)
