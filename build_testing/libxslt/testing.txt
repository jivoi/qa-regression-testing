libxslt has a test suite that is _not_ run at build time.

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep libxslt

Go into the source directory, and do:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make all

Once finished building, run the tests:

make tests >results.txt 2>&1

Inspect the results.txt file for errors.
