ubuntuone-client has an excellent test suite that needs to be run manually.

In a VM (natty and +):
- apt-get build-dep ubuntuone-client
- apt-get install ubuntuone-dev-tools ubuntu-sso-client pyflakes
- get the source:
  - original: apt-get source ubuntuone-client
  - patched: copy over source tree to VM
- enter source tree
- ./configure
- make check > /tmp/results.txt 2>&1

In a VM (lucid) (this currently doesn't work):
- apt-get build-dep ubuntuone-client
- apt-get install pyflakes
- get the source:
  - original: apt-get source ubuntuone-client
  - patched: copy over source tree to VM
- enter source tree
- rm -rf .pc
- ./configure --prefix=/usr
- make check > /tmp/results.txt 2>&1
