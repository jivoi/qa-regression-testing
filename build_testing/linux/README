Comparing output from LTP is a good starting point for getting kernel test
coverage.  The major down-side is that virtually no driver and hardware
support is really tested.  LTP is good for testing interfaces and syscalls.

Currently, ltp-full-20061222.tgz[1] is the base test suite (for Dapper) since
more recent LTP doesn't appear to compile[2].

After unpacking (e.g. on Dapper):

  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ./runltp -p -q -l dapper-$(uname -r).log

Performing a run before and after a kernel upgrade will allow us to compare
any differences.  Note that LTP does appear to have some racey tests, so
it may been required to run the test a few times to get the same output.  :(

To re-run a specific set of tests, add the "-s" flag with a regex for the
desired tests.
