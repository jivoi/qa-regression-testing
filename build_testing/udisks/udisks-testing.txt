udisks has extensive tests that are _not_ run at build time.

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep udisks
sudo apt-get install devscripts fakeroot libatasmart-bin lvm2 kpartx dmeventd

apt-get source udisks
Go into the source directory, and build with "debuild".

Once finished building, run the tests:
--------------------------------------

On quantal+:
sudo mkdir /var/run/udisks


sudo tests/run (tests from source tree)

cd ..
sudo ./udisks-$VER/tests/run (tests system udisks)

i386 note:
----------
On i386, the tests may fail immediately with a "cannot allocate memory"
error when trying to modprobe the scsi_debug module. If this happens, the
systems needs to be rebooted with "vmalloc=300M" added to the kernel boot
command line.
