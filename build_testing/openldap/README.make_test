To run the built-in 'make test' tests, do:

$ sudo apt-get build-dep openldap2.2	(or openldap2.3)
$ sudo apt-get install time		(needed on feisty and higher)
$ fakeroot debian/rules build
$ cd debian/build/tests
$ make tests

The test scripts are in <top level source dir>/tests/scripts (ie *not*
debian/build)

Results:

Dapper:		got to test021-- all passed
Edgy: 		got to test021-- all passed
Feisty:		got to test044-dynlist-- all passed
Gutsy:		test030-relay, test035-meta and test036-meta-concurrency fail
		(will need to move these out of the way for later tests to pass)

For gutsy failed tests, see:

From irc:
15:08 < slangasek> jdstrand: ah, I think I've seen an error such as that
reported against the Debian package, but I don't currently find a bug report
for it.  Is OpenLDAP 2.3 shipping its own embedded copy of libltdl that we're
stripping out?
16:12 < slangasek> jdstrand: make test is sloooow
17:05 < slangasek> jdstrand: ok, from what I see, openldap is assuming a
libltdl that uses RTLD_GLOBAL; that's a bug in libltdl upstream that's fixed in
the Debian/Ubuntu package (using RTLD_GLOBAL causes namespace collisions in the
general case), so openldap's modules need to be fixed to not rely on this
