pymongo has a test suite that can be run manually.

It must be run in a vm or on real hardware with at least 8GB of free disk
space, or it won't work properly.

apt-get build-dep pymongo
apt-get install mongodb
apt-get install python-nose
apt-get install quilt
apt-get install devscripts

apt-get source pymongo

Make sure hosts has the hostname set to 127.0.0.1, not 127.0.1.1.

- go into source tree, and:
nosetests

Some tests may be unreliable and need to be run more than once.
