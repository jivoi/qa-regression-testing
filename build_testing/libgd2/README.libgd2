LIBGD2 TESTING
--------------
libgd2 2.0.35 has a lot of tests that can be used on previous versions. Here
is how:

$ apt-get install cmake 
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
$ tar -zxvf /tmp/libgd20tests-2.0.35.tar.gz
$ dapper and edgy: copy over CMakeLists.txt and config.h.cmake from feisty
$ cmake -DBUILD_TEST=1 .
$ make
$ ctest .

Dapper: needs cmake from edgy (a simple recompile of cmake on dapper is fine).
It also needs CMakeLists.txt and config.h.cmake from feisty

Edgy: needs CMakeLists.txt and config.h.cmake from feisty


** IMPORTANT **
bug00005 sometimes causes a DoS (race condition in cmake?), so you will need to
kill it or disable it
