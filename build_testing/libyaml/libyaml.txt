libyaml has a test suite that is _not_ run at build time, but I couldn't
figure out how to get it to run.

There is a nice test suite in pyyaml, that uses libyaml.

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep pyyaml
apt-get source pyyaml

Go into the source directory, and run the tests:

python setup.py test > /tmp/output.txt 2>&1

This should automatically detect pyyaml, build against it, and run the
tests. Make sure everything succeeds.
