Bind has a test suite that is _not_ run at build time.

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep bind9
sudo apt-get install devscripts fakeroot
sudo apt-get install libnet-dns-perl (required for test suite to run properly)

The test suite needs to have network loopback aliases set up. As root, go
into the bin/tests/system directory and run "sudo ./ifconfig.sh up". Make sure
network loopback aliases have been created by doing a "ifconfig -a".

Go into the source directory, and build with "debuild".

In Ubuntu 14.04, 14.10 and 15.04, one of the test hangs, to disable:
Modify bin/tests/system/conf.sh* to remove "inline".

Once finished building, run the tests:

/etc/init.d/bind9 stop
make test >results.txt 2>&1

On some releases, the test may hang at some point, so make sure you monitor
the output file and kill it when appropriate.

You can see if all the tests succeeded:

grep "^R" results.txt

There's more information about the test suite in README and in
bin/tests/system/README.
