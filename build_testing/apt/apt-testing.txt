APT has some tests that are _not_ run at build time.

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep apt
sudo apt-get install devscripts fakeroot weborf stunnel4

Go into the source directory, and build with "debuild".

Once finished building, run the tests:
--------------------------------------

cd test/integration

sudo ./run-tests

Some tests may fail if the test scripts aren't 755.

This test doesn't exist in Lucid.
On Natty, 2 of the tests failed. Have not investigated.
On Oneiric, 4 of the tests failed. Have not investigated.

This test is deprecated (according to mvo):
-------------------------------------------

For this test, you need to import mvo's key:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 962483E15662C734

and then run the test:
sudo ./pre-upload-check.py -v

On Lucid, 1 of the tests failed. Have not investigated.

The status of this test is unknown (according to mvo):
------------------------------------------------------

cd test
sudo ./test-indexes.sh
