Tk contains automated build tests.

It needs X, so it needs to be run in a VM.

$ apt-get -y source tk8.3 (or 8.0, 8.4, etc.)
$ sudo apt-get -y build-dep tk8.3 (or 8.0, 8.4, etc.)
$ sudo apt-get -y install fakeroot
$ cd (source directory)
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
$ cd unix
$ make test > logfile.txt

These tests seem to be unreliable. Every time they are run, they come up with different results.
Maybe related to running the tests in a VM.
