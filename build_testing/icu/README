icu has a build test-suite.

It is now run automatically on all releases, including precise. Make sure
you check the build logs to see if it ran successfully.


Can use patternexample.odt to test ICU in LibreOffice. This was
found in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=429023

Can use Format/Cells to test ICU in LibreOffice in precise. (Later releases
use harfbuzz)

Watch for regressions, ie LP: 1429043

Can also test by inserting special characters in LibreOffice Writer:
$ oowriter --strace
Insert > Special Character

See Mageia bugs for that testing trick:
