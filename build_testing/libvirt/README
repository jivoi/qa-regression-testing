libvirt
-------

Has a 'make check'. To run do:

$ sudo apt-get install qemu kvm libxml2-utils	# hardy and jaunty
$ sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libxml2-utils 	# karmic and higher
$ sudo apt-get build-dep libvirt		# see below for jaunty
$ cd ./libvirt*
$ fakeroot debian/rules build
$ make check					# do twice so initial build is
						# not in results
$ export MYDIR=`dirname $PWD` ; make check 2>&1 | sed "s#$MYDIR/##g" > /tmp/libvirt_<version>.make_check

Then put /tmp/libvirt_<version>.make_check in results/libvirt/*

Building on 9.04
----------------
Due to https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-buildd/+bug/412186, libvirt will
build on a buildd but not sbuild or pbuilder because it Build-Depends on
open-iscsi, and open-iscsi's initscript has logic to not start if /sys is
not mounted. If /sys is mounted, the initscript will fail and you can't build
the package locally. This is fixed in 9.10 which introduced the
open-iscsi-utils package and has libvirt Build-Depends on it.

To workaround with sbuilder, temporarily comment out this line from
/etc/schroot/mount-defaults:
/sys           /sys            none    rw,rbind        0       0

When done building, uncomment the above line.
