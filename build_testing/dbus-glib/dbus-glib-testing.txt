dbus-glib has a test suite that is _not_ run at build time.

test-dbus.py does build dbus-glib with the test suite enabled, but for a
more detailed comparison of build logs:

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep dbus-glib
sudo apt-get install devscripts


We need to compare the test suite between the original package, and the
new updated package:

Go into the original package source directory, add the following lines
to debian/rules:

--enable-tests \
--enable-checks \
--enable-asserts \

Build in the following way:

debuild > /tmp/before.txt 2>&1


Go into the updated package source directory, add the following lines
to debian/rules:

--enable-tests \
--enable-checks \
--enable-asserts \

Build in the following way:

debuild > /tmp/after.txt 2>&1


You can now compare /tmp/before.txt and /tmp/after.txt to see if any
additional tests have failed.

Make sure the build logs have the following:

        Building unit tests:      yes
        Building assertions:      yes
        Building checks:          yes
