This test has not been hooked up yet to a qrt script but it suffices
for a testcase for LP: #680588 and LP: #954714.

to test:
  $ make
  $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./relro-bt &
  # note what the pid of the backgrounded relro-bt process is for use in
  # the gcore command below

  # sudo needed to get around ptrace restrictions; don't really want to
  # disable them, but maybe for the qrt script
  $ sudo gcore PID

Then running:

  $ gdb -batch -x gdb-batch relro-bt core.PID

should emit something like:

  [New LWP 28326]
  Core was generated by `relro-bt'.
  #0  0x00007f47fa6a82b0 in nanosleep () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
  #0  0x00007f47fa6a82b0 in nanosleep () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
  #1  0x00007f47fa6a816c in sleep () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
  #2  0x00007f47fa9a75ba in lib () at relro-bt-lib.c:5
  #3  0x00000000004005fd in main () at relro-bt.c:5

if things are working correctly. If not, output will look like:

  [New LWP 28326]
  Core was generated by `relro-bt'.
  #0  0x00007f47fa6a82b0 in ?? ()
  #0  0x00007f47fa6a82b0 in ?? ()
  #1  0x00007f47fa6a816c in ?? ()
  #2  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()

(note inability to determine function names and locations.)
