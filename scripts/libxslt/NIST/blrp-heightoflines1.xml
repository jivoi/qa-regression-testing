<TEST>
<PARAGRAPH>This paragraph should have a font size of 14px and a line height
of 20px.  This means that the lines of text within it should be separated by
six pixels, three of which are part of the line-box of each line.  Any images
within the paragraph should increase the height of the line-box so that they fit
within the line box, such as<IMG SRC="oransqr.jpg"/>.  This is
additional text to make sure that there is enough room left below the image so that this
line does not hit the image that is text-top aligned. (NOTE: vertical-align not used
here, so may affect result)</PARAGRAPH>
