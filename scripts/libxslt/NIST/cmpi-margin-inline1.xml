This element is unstyled save for a background color of gray.  However, it contains
an <SPAN>inline element of margin 25px and background-color of red, giving it a
red background and a 25px margin</SPAN>.  Margins on inline elements do not affect
line-height calculations, so all lines in this element should have the same line-height.
However, there should be a 25px margin to the left side of the inline box in the first
line it appears, and a 25px margin to the right side of the inline element box in the
last line where it appears.  Individual properties are tested here.</PARAGRAPH>
