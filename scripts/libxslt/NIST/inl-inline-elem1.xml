<TEST>
<PARAGRAPH>This is a paragraph that has a <SPAN>very long span in it, and the span
has a 10px left border separated from the span by 2pt, and a left margin of 30pt.  The left padding
and border should be present on all sides of the span (although vertical lines should 
appear only at the beginning and the end of the whole span, not on each line).  The 
padding, border, and margin should all be noticeable at the beginnning and end of the span.
However, the line height should not be changed by any of them, so the margin should be 
unnoticeable and the border should overlap text on other lines.</SPAN>  The line spacing
in the whole paragraph should be 200% of the font size.</PARAGRAPH>
