<TEST>
<PARAGRAPH>This paragraph should have a font size of 14px and a line height
of 20px.  This means that the lines of text within it should be separated by
six pixels.  Any images within the paragraph should increase the height of the
 line-box so that they fit, including their left padding (5px), left border (10px) and left margins
 (5px) within the line box, such as <IMG SRC="oransqr.jpg"/>.  This is
additional text to make sure that there is enough room left below the image so that this
line does not hit the image that is text-top aligned.  It is the outer edge of the
margin that should be text-bottom and text-top aligned in this paragraph, so for the
first image the bottom border of the image should begin 15px above the bottom of the
text.(NOTE: vertical-align not used here, so may affect result)</PARAGRAPH>
