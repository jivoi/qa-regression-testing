<TEST>
<PARAGRAPH>This is a paragraph that has a <SPAN>very long span in it, and the span
has a 12px border separated from the span by 2pt of left padding (the difference between the
line height and the font size), which should overlap with the lines of text above and
below the span, since the padding and border should not affect the line height.  The span's
border should have vertical lines only at the beginning and end of the whole span, not
on each line.</SPAN>  The line spacing in the whole paragraph should be 12pt, with font size 10pt.</PARAGRAPH>
