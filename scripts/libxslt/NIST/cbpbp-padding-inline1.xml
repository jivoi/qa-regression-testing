This element is unstyled save for a background color of gray.  However, it contains
an <SPAN>inline element of padding 25px and background-color of red, giving it a red
background and a 25px padding</SPAN>.  Padding on inline elements does not affect line-height
calculations, so all lines in this element should have the same line-height.  There may be 
implementation-specific limits on how much of the padding the user agent is able to display 
above and below each line.  However, there should be at least 25px of padding to the left side
of the inline box in the first line it appears, and 25px of padding to the right side of the
inline element box in the last line where it appears.  Individual properties are being tested here.</PARAGRAPH>
