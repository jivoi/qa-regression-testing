add global option parser to handle reporting package prerequisites

convert ubuntu_release() tests into self.lsb_release['Release'] tests:
    test-apache2.py
    testlib_dns.py
    testlib_httpd.py
    testlib_multimedia.py
    test-xine.py

convert _check_mime_type() tests into self.assertFileType():
    test-ffmpeg.py
    test-ghostscript.py
    test-libsndfile.py
    test-libvorbis.py
    test-libwmf.py
    test-netpbm-free.py
    test-poppler.py

Define "resources" that can be requested... this is starting to stray
into the "framework" side of things.  Basically, if I have a regression
test I'm running and I need to verify that email delivery is still working
from it (e.g. Moodle) I need to know about an email address, IMAP host,
username, and password.  With those details, the regression test can
log into that resource and continue verification.  Similar things are needed
for testing Kerberos or Samba: "I need a Kerberos server", "I need a Samba
mount", etc.
