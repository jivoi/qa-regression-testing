The Canon EOS 400D Color Profiles
=================================

Disclaimer 
----------

Even though these color profiles were primarily generated for my own personal 
use, they may yield good results for you, or they may not. Use at your own risk.

How to use 
----------

To use either profile, you need to start UFRaw and go to the fourth or fifth tab 
(Color Management), depending on whether you have LensFun enabled or not. There 
you can load a color profile as the camera input profile. Verify whether the
gamma is set to 1.0 (default), and linearity is set to 0.0 (default). You should
only use Perceptual or Relative-Colorimetric rendering intents with these 
profiles. Stick to the Perceptual rendering intent if you don't understand 
their meaning.

Production notes 
----------------

Both color profiles were manufactured by photographing a standard IT8.7/2 color 
target in different conditions. Both color profiles were calibrated against the 
following equipment:

 * Canon EOS 400D Digital SLR camera
 * Sigma 17-70mm f2.8-4.5 DC Macro lens
 * B+W F-Pro UV-Haze MRC filter
 * Wolf Faust C1 IT8.7/2 (Charge R080505) target

The first daylight profile was derived from a photo made (outdoors) during a clear 
and bright sunny day slightly after noon (13:12u) on October 20th 2008 in the 
Netherlands. 

The second lightcube profile was derived from a photo made (indoors) inside a white 
lightcube using two 5000K CRI85 daylight saving bulbs as the primary light sources.

Both photos used for profiling were white balanced using the G6 patch of the IT8 
target, which should have been perfectly neutral grey according to the targets 
batch average data.

Both color profiles were generated using ArgyllCMS 1.0.3 by Gill Graeme.

Compatibility 
-------------

Although these color profiles were manufactured specifically for UFRaw, they should
be generic enough to work with most raw converters which allow you to load ICC 
version 2.2.0 compliant input profiles.
