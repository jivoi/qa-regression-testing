Tests are also available for performing tests on images. All commands assume
you are in the 'tests/' directory.

Eg:
$ cd tests/
$ make list-suite-cmds
...
$ make list-suite-privileged-cmds

To run all tests (this will run privileged tests as root and unprivileged tests
as an unprivileged user ('phablet' if it exists, otherwise the user with uid
1000):
$ sudo ./image/run_tests.sh

To run an individual test:
$ ./image/unprivileged/check-packages
$ sudo ./image/privileged/check-apparmor


Continuous Integration on Ubuntu
--------------------------------
As of 2013-11-07, these tests are integrated in CI here:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-test-case-dev/ubuntu-test-cases/touch/files/head:/tests/security

Note, CI does *not* use make or run_tests.sh, but dynamically discovers the
tests.

How to run via UTAH on a target Ubuntu Touch device:
 * On the target device (ie, the one with Ubuntu Touch), make the image
   read/write:
   # adb shell touch /userdata/.writable_image
   # adb shell reboot

   Note, can also use:
   $ phablet-config writable-image
 * On the host device:
   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:utah/stable
   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install utah-client utah
   $ bzr branch lp:ubuntu-test-cases/touch ubuntu-test-cases-touch
   $ cd ubuntu-test-cases-touch
   $ ./scripts/jenkins.sh -s <ADB serial> -a security

   Alternatively, you can run "QUICK" (ie no reboots) with:
   $ ./scripts/jenkins.sh -Q -s <ADB serial> -a security

Note: '<ADB serial>' is the output from 'adb devices'


Testing manually on Ubuntu Touch
--------------------------------
$ adb push ./tests /tmp/tests
$ adb shell /tmp/tests/image/run_tests.sh

Older images with adb running as root:
$ adb shell /tmp/tests/image/privileged/some_root_test
$ adb shell sudo -i -u phablet /tmp/tests/image/unprivileged/some_non-root_test

Newer images with adb running as non-root:
$ adb shell sudo /tmp/tests/image/privileged/some_root_test
$ adb shell /tmp/tests/image/unprivileged/some_non-root_test
