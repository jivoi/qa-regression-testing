t3-jorton-v1.html contains the table for mod_include as related to the fix for
CVE-2009-1195.

The test_mod_include() test in test-apache2.py fails if the patches for
CVE-2009-1195 are not applied. For details, see *all of*:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=489436

Note that all of the above were done *before* the mod_perl regression, so the
following tests differ after applying all the patches and using ssi_exec for the
following:
  # Options, AllowOverride, htaccess
  'Includes', 'Options=IncludesNoExec', '+IncludesNoExec' ... FAIL
  'Includes', 'Options=Includes', '+IncludesNoExec' ... FAIL
  'Includes', 'All', '+IncludesNoExec' ... FAIL

In each case, we have ssi_noexec (meaning, SSI works, but execute does not).
This was verified against the Debian patch in sid (2.2.11-6). Specifically,
 upstream: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=779472
 upstream: http://people.apache.org/~trawick/mod_perl_more_compat.txt

Note that 'Includes', 'All', '+IncludesNoExec' in 2.0 should be ssi_noexec,
and this is how 2.2 operates with the mod_perl_more_compat.txt patch.
