In addition to our test scripts for apache, upstream has a test
framework at:

  http://httpd.apache.org/test/

In particular, the Perl Framework:

  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/test/framework/trunk/

Alas, attempts to use it have been unsuccessful as it doesn't seem to
properly parse the includes in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf to determine
which modules are enabled and need to be loaded in the test
configuration; e.g. setting up the tree with:

  perl Makefile.PL -apxs  /usr/bin/apxs2 -httpd_conf /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

and then running

  t/TEST

fails due to parsing errors in the config file because necessary modules
aren't being loaded.

Work to fix issues, automate this and integrate it within our test
script would be great!
