The tiff upstream maintainers have a tendency to make mistakes that
introduce binary incompatibility between one version of tiff and
another.  In order to verify binary compatibility, it is strongly
recommended to build a new library and install the new library without
installing the new tools.  Then test the tools with the test images
provided by upstream.

Additionally, when checking the sources to look for ABI changes, you
must check both the public header files (tiff.h and tiffio.h) and the
source file libtiff/tif_dirinfo.c which maps tag names to types.
Changes in the tag name to type mapping also result in binary
incompatibility because of the field setting and getting functions
using variable arguments.
