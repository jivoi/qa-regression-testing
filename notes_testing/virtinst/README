Virtinst has a testsuite, but it is not enabled in the build:

In a schroot:
$ apt-get source virtinst
$ cd virtinst-*
# apt-get build-dep virtinst
# apt-get install pylint
# locale-gen en_US.utf8
$ fakeroot ./debian/rules build
$ python setup.py test
$ python setup.py test_cli

scripts/test-libvirt.py has several virtinst tests. You are highly encouraged
to run them.

There is also:
$ python setup.py test_urls	# this is tested in test-libvirt.py
$ python setup.py check		# doesn't work with Ubuntu's pylint
