aptdaemon has some tests that are _not_ run at build time.

In a graphical VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep aptdaemon
sudo apt-get install python-unittest2 python-nose fakeroot python-mock lintian

Go into the source directory, and:

$sudo nosetests
$sudo nosetests3 (trusty+ only)

On Trusty and above, all tests are expected to pass.
On Precise, one test is currently failing.

Using software-center to install and uninstall packages also tests
aptdaemon extensively.
