For squid-cgi testing, I found the following two commands useful:

- w3m http://localhost/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi
- curl -d server=localhost -d operation=... http://locahost/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi

wget --post-data didn't work so well; curl -d worked well immediately.

Passwords are only needed if the squid configuration has passwords for
the various operations.
