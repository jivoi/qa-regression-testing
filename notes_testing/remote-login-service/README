remote-login-service has a test suite that runs during build, but it has
some dbus failures when run on a buildd. To manually run the test suite:

In a VM, do the following:

sudo apt-get build-dep remote-login-service
sudo apt-get install devscripts

Go into the source directory, and build with "debuild".

Once finished building, run the tests:

make check


Some info from ted:

gdbus call --session --dest com.canonical.RemoteLogin --object-path /com/canonical/RemoteLogin --method com.canonical.RemoteLogin.GetServersForLogin https://uccs.landscape.canonical.com/ username password true

Then you can use up arrow to try different combinations ;-)
