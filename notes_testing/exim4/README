Exim4 has a particular way of handling configuration.

In the debian/ directory, there are EDITME.* files that contain the
configuration options for a particular setup. If those options need to
change during a security update, you must proceed the following way:

mkdir /tmp/EXIM
cd /tmp/EXIM
cp -a /{original-location}/exim4-4.72 .
make -f debian/rules unpack-configs

You can then modify the EDITME.* files. Once done:

make -f debian/rules pack-configs

This will place the new EDITME files into the debian/ directory.
You can then copy them over to your real debian/ directory location.
