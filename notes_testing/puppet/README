Puppet has a test suite in the puppet-testsuite package.

To test in a VM (as root):

apt-get install puppet puppet-testsuite
cd /usr/share/puppet-testsuite
rake test > /tmp/results.txt 2>&1

On karmic, and possibly in previous releases, the test suite has an
incorrect path specified, and must be fixed with the patch located in
the current directory.

On karmic, some tests are known to fail. See the results directory.
