nbd has a test suite that is run during build. To test client/server with
a couple of virtual machines:

On server:
apt-get install nbd-server
dd if=/dev/zero of=/opt/imagefile bs=1024 count=100000
mkfs -t ext4 /opt/imagefile

Create /etc/nbd-server/config containing:

[generic]
[imagefile]
  exportname = /opt/imagefile

Restart daemon:
/etc/init.d/nbd-server restart

On client:
apt-get install nbd-client
mkdir /mnt/imagefile

nbd-client servername /dev/nbd0 -name imagefile
mount /dev/nbd0 /mnt/imagefile

Create files, and check md5sums, etc.

To unmount:
nbd-client -d /dev/nbd0


To test old style configuration:

On server:
[generic]
  oldstyle = true
[imagefile]
  exportname = /opt/imagefile
  port = 10000

On client:
nbd-client servername 10000 /dev/nbd0
