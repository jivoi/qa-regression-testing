maas can be tested on Canonistack in multiple-layer virtualization.
However, actually using the virtualized virtual machines might be faster
on an own-box with the ability to turn on nested KVM. (I have not tried.)
Canonistack is nice because it is easy to provision several large
instances and run multiple tests in parallel.

Once the credentials are populated and configured, euca-describe-images to
discover the AMIs for the releases being tested.

Replace the key name with your key name, and the ami-... with the desired AMI.

euca-run-instances -k sarnold_lcy02 -t m1.large ami-000005d9

Give it a few minutes to start.

euca-describe-instances

ssh ...

When you're all done, destroy the instance. Find the name above, then:

euca-terminate-instances i-00005980


Method One:
Scott Moser recommended using the following as testing guide:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~virtual-maasers/charms/precise/virtual-maas/trunk/view/head:/README-nojuju.txt

This relies heavily upon the vmaas juju charm and hooks.
I did not have success with this, but it all looked plausible.


Method Two:
Scott Moser has older scripts for testing maas that gave me enough success
to test some updates. I wouldn't call it a wonderful experience but it
worked well enough to get the job done. A real MAAS test lab would be
better. Anyway:

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~smoser/maas/maas-pkg-test/view/head:/maas-precise-1.2.txt
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~smoser/maas/maas-pkg-test/view/head:/maas-ephemeral-test-quantal.txt

To avoid these being lost, I've included them in this directory. Skip the
daily-ppa step, feel free to skip the reboot, and when you start images
using the xkvm script (also included in the directory in case smoser's
personal host changes..) know that you can get the KVM console with alt+2
and from there "quit" works great. tmux or screen before starting xkvm
helps greatly. It'll take a long time before you see login: prompts, five
or ten minutes, but the things actually work. No password, use the
in-instance ssh key.



The maas-cli program is a simple interface in front of a web-accessible
API. w3m very nearly works well enough to try it it, if you wish, but the
command line tool can do anything the web interface can do. 


Presumably in time "juju deploy vmaas" will "just work". Try it out before
going down these manual routes.


Sorry there's no QRT integration. Here's simple one-liners to check
previous security fixes:

http://localhost:10080/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/?op=test<script>alert(document.domain)</script>balh
GOOD: displays results as plain text
BAD: javascript popup in browser

ls -l /etc/maas/txlongpoll.yaml
GOOD: root:maas 640
BAD: root:root 664

No one-liner for the integrity checking of downloaded images; ^S during
the maas import images step, change the downloaded file, ^Q.
