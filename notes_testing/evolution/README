Migrating to a New Computer (old)
---------------------------------

To migrate settings from one system to another, see:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateEvolutionToNewComputer

Basically:

1.  Run these two command on both the source and the target computer (these
stop the programs that might interfere with your copy):
$ gconftool-2 --shutdown
$ evolution --force-shutdown

2.  Copy the directories ~/.evolution, ~/.gconf/apps/evolution and
~/.gnome2_private/Evolution from the source computer to the same place on the
target computer.

3.  Start Evolution on the target computer (this will automatically start the
programs that you stopped in step 1).

Note: Take care not to start any Gnome applications between steps 1 and 2, as
these will automatically restart the programs that you want to have stopped.


Migrating to a New Computer (new: Ubuntu Hardy and later)
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to File/Backup Settings...
2. Save somewhere (eg /home/<username>/evolution-backup.tar.gz
3. Copy evolution-backup.tar.gz to new computer.
4. Open evolution and choose to import evolution-backup.tar.gz


Resetting Evolution
-------------------
It is often useful to completely remove evolution's settings when testing, as
evolution crashes may corrupt it's configuration and files.

1. run 'evolution --force-shutdown'
2. logout out of X
3. run these commands
$ gconftool-2 --shutdown
$ rm -rf ~/.evolution, ~/.gconf/apps/evolution ~/.gnome2_private/Evolution
4. log back in

Note: you will have to completely reconfigure evolution on startup


NSS
---
See notes_testing/nss/README for more information. To preconfigure evolution
with the nss settings in the README:
1. copy evolution-repack.sh and evolution-backup-hardy.tar.gz from this folder
   to the new machine
2. run './evolution-repack.sh ./evolution-backup-hardy.tar.gz' as the user
   which will be conducting the test
3. start evolution by importing evolution-backup-$USER.tar.gz

These were created by setting up all the accounts, then doing 'File/Backup
Settings...'. Seems each release needs its own backup since the version is
checked. Can verify it is ok with:
$ /usr/lib/evolution/2*/evolution-backup --check ~/evolution-backup-<release>.tar.gz

Look in plugins/backup-restore/backup.c for how evolution creates and verifies
the backups.
