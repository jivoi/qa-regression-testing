How to test nvidia:

1- Install Ubuntu on nvidia hardware, dist-upgrade to latest updates
2- Install one of the nvidia drivers:
   - apt-get install nvidia-current
   - apt-get install nvidia-current-updates (Oneiric+)
   - apt-get install nvidia-173
   - apt-get install nvidia-173-updates (Oneiric+)
   - apt-get install nvidia-96
   - apt-get install nvidia-96-updates (Oneiric+)
3- Reboot
4- Make sure the nvidia driver is running (grep NVIDIA /etc/Xorg.0.log)
5- Test PoC if available (may render machine unstable, and require a reboot)
6- Capture glxinfo data: (glxinfo > ~/pre-update.txt)
7- Activate PPA, apt-get dist-upgrade, look for errors when dkms is rebuilt
8- Reboot
9- Make sure the nvidia driver is running (grep NVIDIA /etc/Xorg.0.log)
10- Test PoC if available
11- Capture glxinfo data: (glxinfo > ~/post-update.txt)
12- Make sure glxinfo didn't change (diff -Naur pre-update.txt post-update.txt)
13- Remove nvidia driver (dpkg -P nvidia-current nvidia-settings)
14- Reboot, and test next driver. All drivers must be tested on all
    releases, for both amd64 and i386.

Notes:

- For Lucid, you _must_ use jockey-gtk to install and uninstall nvidia drivers
  as there are a bunch of alternatives that need to be switched. Natty and
  later does the right thing automatically when installing the packages.
- Natty released with an uninstallable nvidia-96 driver package. There is a
  package in -proposed that is compatible with natty's X server. Security
  update should be based on that package.
- There is a source package called "nvidia-graphics-drivers-180" in Lucid
  and Natty. The binary packages that contain the actual driver have been
  superseded by nvidia-graphics-drivers. There still are some transitional
  packages that are provided by the source. In other words,
  nvidia-graphics-drivers-180 does not produce code that is installable in
  the archive, so can be completely ignored for security updates.

Debugging DKMS:

- Source is installed in /usr/src/nvidia*
- Patches are in /usr/src/nvidia*/patches
- dkms.conf file is in /usr/src/nvidia*

Check status:
dkms status

Rebuild dkms module (to see if patches are applied):
dkms remove  -m nvidia-current -v 295.49 --all
dkms add     -m nvidia-current -v 295.49
dkms build   -m nvidia-current -v 295.49
dkms install -m nvidia-current -v 295.49


For jockey to detect newer nvidia versions, the repo containing the new
packages must be signed, and the signing key must be added to the test
system with apt-key.

In Quantal, the required kernel source isn't installed by default, resulting
in the nvidia DKMS module to fail to build. Before using the software-sources
tool to install the nvidia drivers, ensure the source is installed with:
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic
