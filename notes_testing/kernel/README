See scripts/test-kernel* for the most up to date information.

kernel-test-wrapper.sh tries to run scripts/test-kernel* in one run. Also see
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/PublicationNotes for more information.

To bundle up the qrt scripts into /tmp, use scripts/make-test-tarball on
scripts/test-kernel*py except for test-kernel-hardening.py which is for
features not yet present in the Ubuntu kernel. The resulting list is currently:

    test-kernel-panic.py
    test-kernel-root-ops.py
    test-kernel.py
    test-kernel-security.py
    test-kernel-aslr-collisions.py
