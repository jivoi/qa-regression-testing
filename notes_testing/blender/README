Blender doesn't work in a VM using a VNC display. It must be tested on real
hardware (or maybe an SDL VM).

On the main Blender download page[1], there's a section that has "Regression
Files". These are zip files containing a bunch of blender files that test
blender functionality.

Since the Blender version in dapper is a little old, we need to get an older
version of the Regression Files, available in the same directory[2].

Start blender and open the files in the zip one by one. Most of them will have
instructions that get displayed on the screen.
