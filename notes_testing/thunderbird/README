For testing thunderbird, can use the tarball in the directory for migrating
and testing various accounts. It was created using 2.0.0.12 on 8.04.

The following is pre-setup for connecting to the hardy-multi.example.com VM:
pop3 (ubuntu-pop3, password is 'pop3')
pop3s (ubuntu-pop3s, password is 'pop3s')
pop3 TLS (ubuntu-pop3tls, password is 'pop3tls')
imap (ubuntu-imap, password is 'imap')
imaps (ubuntu-imaps, password is 'imaps')
imap TLS (ubuntu-imaptls, password is 'imaptls')
smtp
smtp/auth (ubuntu-smtpauth, password is 'smtpauth')
smtp/auth TLS (ubuntu-smtpauth-tls, password is 'smtpauth-tls')

The addressbook has entries for the above email addresses as well as the
'ubuntu-pop@example.com', 'ubuntu-imap@example.com' and 'ubuntu@example.com'
email aleases. The News and Blogs is setup for USNs.

See README.multipurpose_vm for details on setting up hardy-multi.example.com
and notes_testing/nss/README for more information on email.

Testing in a VM
---------------
$ cd $HOME
$ rm -rf ./.mozilla-thunderbird ./.thunderbird # WARNING: this deletes config
$ tar -zcvf /tmp/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.12_setup.tar.gz
Or:
$ tar -zcvf /tmp/thunderbird-3.0.4_setup.tar.gz

Start thunderbird (does import)
Stop thunderbird
Start thunderbird (start testing)

The whole 'start, stop, start' routine is to make sure the migration went ok.
This probably isn't needed for thunderbird 2.0, but is needed for 2.0 -> 3.0
upgrades (which are known to have problems). 2.0 -> <=3.1.5 (at least) will
lose all the imap accounts. Use thunderbird-3.0.4_setup.tar.gz instead.

Further testing:
* Importing CA pem file (see nss/README)
 * adding (use this site to identify websites is checked)
 * viewing
 * no prompts when connecting to server
 * after the above, go back into the cert manager and uncheck (use this site to
   identify websites is checked). SSL/TLS connections should now prompt.
* adding of a new email account
* Email functions (in addition to all the protocols, above)
 * reply
 * reply-all
 * forward
 * delete
 * junk
 * archive
 * send plain text
 * send html (note enigmail defaults (see below))
 * Sent folder works
 * Trash works
 * preview works
 * next, previous, pageup, pagedown
Folder views (as of 3.1.x):
 * All folders
 * Unread folders
 * Favorite folders
 * Recent folders
 * Unified folders
* Addressbook:
 * drag and drop for Collected to Personal
 * adding a new entry
 * editing an existing entry
 * autocomplete in the To: field
 * prefers HTML is honored (note enigmail defaults (see below))
* News and Blogs:
 * retrieves feeds
 * can view as RSS summary
 * can view as HTML
* Search by address
* Enigmail:
 * Go through the setup wizard (accepting the defaults is fine-- note that by
   default enigmail disables HTML mail)
 * Generate a new key (you may want to do other testing to offset the lack of
 * entropy. You may also do in a terminal 'find /usr -type f -exec cat {} \;'
   to help speed things along)
 * Send a GPG-signed email and confirm that the receiving account correctly
   verifies the signature
* Lightning:
 * Create an event with another account added to the attendance list and an
   upcoming alert
 * Verify the invitation in the receiving account
 * Verify the alert occurs


Multiple VM Setup
-----------------
If using snapshotted VMs with lp:ubuntu-qa-tools/vm-tools as described in
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/TestingEnvironment, for the tested
systems:

$ copy_sppa_to_repos --ppa=ubuntu-mozilla-security thunderbird
$ uvt start sec-lucid-amd64 sec-lucid-i386 sec-maverick-amd64 sec-maverick-i386 sec-natty-amd64 sec-natty-i386
$ vm-scp -p sec ./thunderbird-3.0.4_setup.tar.gz $HOME/
$ uvt cmd -p sec "cd $HOME ; tar -zxvf ./thunderbird-3.0.4_setup.tar.gz"
$ uvt cmd -p sec -r "apt-get install -y --force-yes thunderbird thunderbird-gnome-support enigmail xul-ext-lightning" # note lucid does not have xul-ext-lightning

Then login to each VM and start and stop thunderbird (to migrate the settings
to the released version of thunderbird in the archive).

Then upgrade thunderbird with:
$ uvt repo -e -p sec
$ uvt cmd -p sec -r "apt-get upgrade  # be careful to watch the output here"

Then in each VM start thunderbird and start testing (see 'Testing in a VM',
above).
