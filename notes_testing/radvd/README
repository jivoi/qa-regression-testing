Testing radvd:
--------------

radvd gives out ipv6 adresses by advertising them on the local network.
Two machines are needed to test it: a server, and a client that gets
restarted after the server daemon is running.

To set up the server:

- # apt-get install radvd
- # cp /usr/share/doc/radvd/examples/simple-radvd.conf /etc/radvd.conf
- Uncomment net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf
- # sysctl -p
- # /etc/init.d/radvd start

Boot a client, look at eth0 ipv6 address. If server is not running, address
should be link-local and start with fe80::. If server is running, client
should get a 2001:db8 ipv6 address.
