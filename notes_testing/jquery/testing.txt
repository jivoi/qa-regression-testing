Depending on the release, the jquery package contains both the source code,
and possibly a pre-built version of the resulting javascript file. Make
sure that the fix actually makes it's way to the resulting binary package
before uploading and testing.

jquery on lucid contains a test suite. Once you've patched dist/jquery.js,
go to the test/ directory and launch "firefox index.html". Later releases
don't include a test suite.

Testing jquery in an automated way is complex, as it is executed by the
browser on the client side. The best way is to test it interactively.
