For general validation of mesa, the piglit test suite can be used.

1. Install prerequisites:
   * sudo apt-get --yes install cmake g++ mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev \
        libtiff4-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev python-numpy \
	freeglut3-dev x11proto-gl-dev libxrender-dev
2. Checkout the piglit test suite from upstream
   * git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/piglit
   * cd piglit; cmake . ; make
3. DISPLAY=:0 piglit-run.py tests/all.tests mesa802.results
4. Install mesa 8.0.4
5. DISPLAY=:0 piglit-run.py tests/all.tests mesa804.results
6. piglit-summary-html.py summary/compare mesa802.results mesa804.results

The tests take several hours to run.

Note: Piglit is not a comprehensive test suite and cannot guarantee
that there are no regressions. However, it is being actively maintained
and updated with new tests by the driver maintainers as they add
features and fix bugs in mesa, so should have decent coverage for
recently made code changes (which is where regressions are more likely
to live).
