Building ia32-libs:
-------------------

The ia32-libs package contains both source packages and binary packages
for all 32-bit libraries that are listed in the fetch-and-build file.

The fetch-and-build script is used to re-download the packages, and
optionally to rebuild all the source packages. See debian/README.build for
more information.

When rebuilding for a security update, we don't need to recompile all the
source packages. Simply using the fetch-and-build script is enough to pull
down the binary packages from the archive.

Make sure the sources.list.deb file contains the -security pocket to pull
in updated packages.

This is how I (mdeslaur) used the fetch-and-build script in a schroot:

schroot -c hardy-i386 -u root
apt-get install dctrl-tools
su - mdeslaur
./fetch-and-build

I then exited the schroot once the package were all downloaded and built
the package for amd64 with umt.
