The test-postgresql.py test script integrates the testsuite in postgres-common.

Essentially (for 8.4, use the appropriate version you want to test):
$ sudo apt-get -y install python-unit postgresql-8.4 postgresql-common libpq-dev libpqxx-dev procps hunspell-en-us language-pack-ru ssl-cert locales python-pygresql postgresql-plpython-8.4 postgresql-plperl-8.4 postgresql-pltcl-8.4 postgresql-server-dev-8.4

$ sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8 ru_RU ru_RU.UTF-8
$ sudo locale-gen

Note that 10.04 won't use Russian, so you'll need a different language pack
and locale-gen command.

# run the tests
$ cd /usr/share/postgresql-common
$ sudo -i
# LANG=en_US.UTF-8 ./testsuite		# to quit after the first failure
# LANG=en_US.UTF-8 sh +e ./testsuite

# to disable tests:
$ sudo mv ./t/<test>.t ./t/<test>.t.disabled
