hplip is composed essentially of the following:

- A ghostscript driver (hpijs)
- A cups backend (hp)
- A sane backend (hpaio)
- A user interface (hp-toolkit)
- Command line tools (hp-*)
- A daemon for the user interface and command-line tools (hpssd)

Most of these require a physical printer/scanner to be attached to the local computer, so they can't be tested using a script.

The best way to test hplip is by using a virtual machines with a redirected usb port to a local port that has a HP multifunction device plugged in.

The version of libvirt that comes with Intrepid has support for USB devices in it's XML file[1], but doesn't seem to pass these parameters to kvm. For now, we can get USB support by using kvm directly on the disk images.

Make sure the printer is plugged in and turned on.

Get your printer's usb device number:

mdeslaur@mdlinux:~$ lsusb
Bus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 004 Device 006: ID 03f0:7d04 Hewlett-Packard Deskjet F2100 Printer series
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 045e:0040 Microsoft Corp. Wheel Mouse Optical
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0a5c:2110 Broadcom Corp. Bluetooth Controller
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub

Start the virtual machine you want to use in virt-manager. Get the command line it used:

mdeslaur@mdlinux:~$ ps aux | grep kvm
root     11253  8.9  7.3 518072 292392 ?       Sl   08:27   1:02 /usr/bin/kvm -S -M pc -m 256 -smp 1 -name sec-gutsy-i386 -monitor pty -boot c -drive file=/home/mdeslaur/machines/sec-gutsy-i386/disk0.qcow2,if=ide,index=0,boot=on -net nic,macaddr=00:16:36:0d:98:5e,vlan=0,model=e1000 -net tap,fd=14,script=,vlan=0,ifname=vnet2 -serial none -parallel none -usb -vnc 127.0.0.1:2

Install hplip:

$ sudo apt-get -y install hplip hplip-gui (no hplip-gui in dapper)

Make sure you're a member of the "lpadmin" group in the VM.

Power down the virtual machine.

kvm needs to access /proc/bus/usb, which is no longer used. Work around this issue temporarily:

sudo mount -t usbfs usbfs /proc/bus/usb/
sudo chmod -R a+rw /proc/bus/usb/

Launch KVM directly, but with "-S" removed to start automatically, "-vnc 127.0.0.1:2" removed to get an SDL console, and "-usbdevice host:03f0:7d04" added for the usb device:

mdeslaur@mdlinux:~$ /usr/bin/kvm -M pc -m 256 -smp 1 -name sec-gutsy-i386 -monitor pty -boot c -drive file=/home/mdeslaur/machines/sec-gutsy-i386/disk0.qcow2,if=ide,index=0,boot=on -net nic,macaddr=00:16:36:0d:98:5e,vlan=0,model=e1000 -net tap,fd=14,script=,vlan=0,ifname=vnet2 -serial none -parallel none -usb -usbdevice host:03f0:7d04

Networking will not work, but this is not needed to test the local printer.

Make sure the following works:

* Setting up the printer
* Printing the test page (goodbye ink cartridge!)
* Using hp-toolbox:
  - Status tab should say "The printer is idle."
  - Supplies tab should indicate ink levels of printer
  - On Tools tab, select "View Device Information" and make
    sure stuff is populated
  - On Fuctions tab, select "Scan a document" and test scanning
    by using the "Acquire preview" button


Notes on Dapper:

- hp-toolbox is included in the main hplip package, but it doesn't appear in the menus.
- gnome-cups-setup doesn't seem to use "hp:" ports by default, so hp-toolbox will not work. You must manually select the printer, and change the port to "hp:" instead of "usb:"
