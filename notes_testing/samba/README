Testing Samba with Active Directory (AD)
----------------------------------------
There may be times when an AD backend is needed for testing. When this mode of
operation is in use, "security = ADS" will be specified in the smb.conf file.

There are two Samba pages I found helpful while setting Samba up:

http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/domain-member.html
http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_&_Active_Directory

Here are some notes on the process:

1) The first thing to do is decide how you want DNS handled. All AD setup
   documents that I found say that it is best to let the Domain Controller
   handle DNS. I didn't follow this recommendation because my Domain Controller
   and all of my domain members were virtualized and connected to libvirt's
   "default" network. The dnsmasq process spawned by libvirt would handle DNS
   for me. I set an explicit DNS domain for the default network:

   $ sudo virsh net-edit default

   Add <domain name='DOMAIN'/> just under the <mac ... /> line. Replace DOMAIN
   with the DNS domain you wish to use.

2) The next thing to do is to set up a Domain Controller. Samba4, which is
   still in alpha at the time of writing, has the ability to act as a Domain
   Controller. However, the most obvious Domain Controller would be a Windows
   Server installation. Windows Server 2008 trial downloads are available from
   Microsoft and successfully install as a QEMU/KVM guest on Precise.

   I followed this guide to set up Active Directory on win2k8:

   http://www.elmajdal.net/win2k8/setting_up_your_first_domain_controller_with_windows_server_2008.aspx

3) Next, you'll need to install and configure Samba and Kerberos in your Ubuntu
   guest:

   $ sudo apt-get install samba winbind krb5-user

   You'll be prompted for a few values when krb5-config is being configured.
   'Default Kerberos version 5 realm' is the DNS domain in all caps. 'Kerberos
   servers for your realm' and 'Administrative server for your Kerberos realm'
   is the FQDN of the Domain Controller.

4) Replace the contents of /etc/samba/smb.conf with the minimal configuration
   below. Adjust the first three config variables to the appropriate values for
   your environment.

---
[global]
   # The NetBIOS name can be 15 chars max. If the samba server's hostname is
   # longer than 15 chars, truncate it here.
   netbios name = sec-precise-amd

   # The domain NetBIOS name. By default, "the leftmost label in the DNS domain
   # name up to the first 15 bytes". You may have changed it to something else
   # in the Active Directory Domain Services Installation Wizard.
   workgroup = NETBIOSDOMAIN

   # The kerberos realm. This should match default_realm in krb5.conf.
   realm = REALM

   # Nothing below should need to be modified. See smb.conf(5) for details.
   security = ADS
   encrypt passwords = yes
   idmap uid = 1200-2000
   idmap gid = 1200-2000
   winbind enum users = yes
   winbind enum groups = yes
---

   You may wish to set up shares at this point, but that is not required to
   join the AD domain.

5) Open /etc/nsswitch.conf and append 'winbind' to the end of the passwd, group and shadow lines. The modified lines of the file will look like this:

---
passwd:         compat winbind
group:          compat winbind
shadow:         compat winbind
---

6) Restart winbind and smbd:

   $ sudo sh -c 'service winbind stop && service smbd restart && service winbind start'

7) Obtain and cache Kerberos ticket-granting ticket:

   $ kinit Administrator@V.TIHIX.COM

   The command above, and all preceding commands, assumes that 'Administrator'
   is the AD domain administrator. You'll be prompted for account password.

8) Join the domain:

   $ sudo net ads join -U Administrator

   If this is being done in a test environment, you may want to specify
   passwords on the command line. The net program's -U option takes a
   user%password argument, like so:

   $ sudo net ads join -U Administrator%ubuntu-win2k8

   Obviously, this should not be used in a production environment.

9) It seems like you need to restart winbind and smbd again for everything to
   work correctly:

   $ sudo sh -c 'service winbind stop && service smbd restart && service winbind start'

10) Now you can get a user listing throughought the AD domain:

   $ getent passwd

   You'll see that remote user account ID's are mapped starting at the 'idmap
   uid' range specified in smb.conf. You can su to those remotes accounts, too:

   $ su - WORKGROUP\\foo

   Replace WORKGROUP with the workgroup specified in smb.conf and foo with the
   remote user name.

11) You can list, grant, and revoke Microsoft Local Security Authority (LSA)
    privileges associated with each account:

   $ net rpc rights list foo -U Administrator%ubuntu-win2k8 -S $(hostname)

   $ net rpc rights grant foo SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege -U Administrator%ubuntu-win2k8

   $ net rpc rights revoke foo SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege -U Administrator%ubuntu-win2k8
