= Environment for local builds =
***IMPORTANT***
You need *at least* a 2.5G chroot for build depends (assuming that your actual
build is not within the chroot). If using sbuild, make sure your schroot is
setup using at least:
LV_SIZE=2.5G
SNAPSHOT_SIZE=2100M

and make sure that your /build is bind mounted somewhere with a lot of space
(at least 10G).

Also be sure that the virtual memory is set to 'unlimited' if using ulimit
in your build environment (eg 'ulimit -v unlimited'). If using umt, set
"pkgbuild_ulimit_v=unlimited" in ~/.ubuntu-security-tools.conf.

= Finding patches =
Some source branches can be found out:
http://svn.services.openoffice.org/opengrok/

libreoffice patches from Fedora can be found in:
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/libreoffice.git (fedora 15 ~ natty,
 fedora 16 ~ oneiric, fedora 17 ~ precise)


= Patching =

== libreoffice on 11.04 and 11.10 ==
 * the sources are all in libreoffice-build/src in bz2 files
 * patches are in libreoffice-build/patches
 * add the patch to patches/dev300 or patches/hotfixes. It should end with
   .diff, not .patch

It is best to create the patches in a schroot. Eg:
1. Prepare the schroot
$ schroot -c natty-amd64 -u root
(natty-amd64)# apt-get build-dep libreoffice
(natty-amd64)# apt-get install quilt
(natty-amd64)# apt-get install firefox-dev
(natty-amd64)# su <you>
(natty-amd64)$ apt-get source libreoffice
(natty-amd64)$ cd ./libreoffice-*
(natty-amd64)$ QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches quilt push -a # ensure the patches are applied

2. Develop a clean patch
(natty-amd64)$ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="nogsi" fakeroot debian/rules build # Ctrl-c after configure is done*
(natty-amd64)$ cp -aL ./build ./build.orig
(natty-amd64)$ cd ./build
(natty-amd64)$ <apply patch>
(natty-amd64)$ cd ../build && diff -Naurp build.orig build > /tmp/foo.diff

* Note that on 11.10 configure fails but after the patches are applied (ie,
  should be able to move to the next step)

3. Adust each patch to remove the build/ and build.orig/ bits from the patch
   such that they will apply when in the build/ directory and using patch -p0.
   Eg:
$ sed -i -e 's#\-\-\- build.orig/#--- #' -e 's#\+\+\+ build/#+++ #' /tmp/foo.diff

4. Add the clean patch to the build system
(natty-amd64)$ rm -rf ./build ./build.orig
(natty-amd64)$ cd <toplevel debian source package>
(natty-amd64)$ fakeroot debian/rules clean
(natty-amd64)$ QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches quilt pop -a && quilt push -a
(natty-amd64)$ QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches quilt new bar.diff
(natty-amd64)$ QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches quilt add libreoffice-build/patches/dev300/foo.diff libreoffice-build/patches/dev300/apply
(natty-amd64)$ cp /tmp/foo.diff libreoffice-build/patches/dev300
(natty-amd64)$ <adjust libreoffice-build/patches/dev300/apply accordingly>*
(natty-amd64)$ QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches quilt refresh
(natty-amd64)$ QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches quilt pop -a && quilt push -a && quilt pop -a # make sure it applies cleanly

* To adjust libreoffice-build/patches/dev300/apply, do something like:
[ UbuntuOnly ]
foo.diff, jdstrand

11.04 and 11.10 can use 'UbuntuOnly'.

What the above does is create the debian/patches/bar.diff file, which when
applied adds the libreoffice-build/patches/dev300/foo.diff file and updates
libreoffice-build/patches/dev300/apply to apply foo.diff.

Note that the libreoffice package is split with two code copies:
libreoffice
libreoffice-l10n

The are identical sources but ship different binaries (why?), so depending on
the patch, you'll have to patch both.


== libreoffice on 12.04 and later ==
Standard Debian package (quilt)


== openoffice.org on 10.04 ==

Same as with libreoffice on 11.04 except:
 * the sources are all in ooo-build/src in bz2 files
 * patches are in ooo-build-3-2-0-10/patches
 * add the patch to patches/dev300. It should end with .diff, not .patch
 * add the patch name to patches/dev300/apply under the '[ Security ]' section
   at the end

If building in a schroot, may see:
ERROR: ld.so: object 'libfakeroot-sysv.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.

These can be safely ignored.


= Build =
For parallel builds:
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="num-cpus=3"

Can also try to use ccache:
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="num-cpus=3,ccache"

libreoffice:
If building in a schroot:
$ schroot -c natty-amd64 -u root
# apt-get build-dep libreoffice
(natty-amd64)# su <you>
(natty-amd64)$ quilt push -a
(natty-amd64)$ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="num-cpus=3" fakeroot debian/rules build
(natty-amd64)$ fakeroot debian/rules clean

With sbuild:
$ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="num-cpus=3,ccache" sbuild -A -d natty-amd64 -a libreoffice*.dsc
$ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="num-cpus=3,ccache" sbuild -A -d natty-amd64 -a 'libreoffice: & ccache' libreoffice*.dsc

With umt*:
$ umt build # libreoffice
$ umt build --dependency-resolution=manual # oo.o

* Note that umt changes the sbuild dep resolver to use 'aptitude' on 11.04 and
  11.10.
