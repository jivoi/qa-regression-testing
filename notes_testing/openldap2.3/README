Testsuite
---------
openldap2.3 on hardy does not have the test suite turned on by default
(openldap in 9.10 (at least) and later does). In order to run it, do:

$ sudo apt-get build-dep openldap2.3
$ sudo apt-get install time
$ apt-get source openldap2.3
$ cd openldap2.3-<version>
$ fakeroot debian/rules build
$ RESOLV_MULTI=off make -C debian/build test 2>&1 | tee ../test.results

Look in tests/scripts for the scripts. At script test035-meta and after scripts
start failing regularly which is because of back_meta not working right (see
2.4.10-1) (http://www.mail-archive.com/openldap-its@openldap.org/msg00520.html).

If you remove these scripts, then the tests will pass:
test035-meta
test035-meta-concurrency

Test run output is in debian/build/testrun. A preliminary patch to fix the
back_meta tests is in this directory.
