libssh is used by remmina. You can use remmina to establish an ssh
connection to test it.

You can also build the sample applications like so:

install build dependencies:
# apt-get build-dep libssh

create a separate clean source tree:
# cp -a quantal quantal.test
# cd quantal.test
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ../../libssh-0.5.2
# make

samplessh: sample ssh client. Type "yes" to accept prompts.
samplesftp: connects to an sftp server and creates a big /tmp/grosfichier file
samplesshd: sample sshd server. Spawn with -p to specify port. Client
 must use user 'aris' with password 'lala'. Use -T on client to disable
 pseudo-tty. Stuff typed into client should print on server side. Must run
 server as root to access host keys. On lucid, must use the libssh sample
 client to test.
libssh_scp: sample scp client
exec: connects locally and does 'lsof'
scp_download: connects locally, creates files in /tmp and fetches them
senddata: connects locally and sends data to /dev/null
