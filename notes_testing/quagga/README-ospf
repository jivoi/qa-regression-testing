To test ospf, you need to set up some virtual machines with isolated
networks. In virt-manager/libvirt, set up two "isolated networks" in
addition to the default "NAT" network that is already configured. We will
be setting up the two virtual machines in the following fashion:


                 -------------------------------------   192.168.122.0/24
                     |                           |       (default NAT net)
                     |                           |
                   +---+                       +---+
   10.1.0.0/24  .1 |   |.1    10.10.0.0/24   .2|   |.1    10.2.0.0/24
   ----------------+   +-----------------------+   +-----------------
   isonet1         |   |        isonet2        |   |          isonet1
                   +---+                       +---+
                    vm1                         vm2

Add two addition network interfaces to each vm, one on each isolated
network. Boot up the VMs, and add static networking configuration to their
/etc/network/interfaces files:

VM1:
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 10.1.0.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth2
iface eth2 inet static
address 10.10.0.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

VM2:
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 10.2.0.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth2
iface eth2 inet static
address 10.10.0.2
netmask 255.255.255.0

Reboot them, and make sure they can ping each other's 10.10.0.0/24 address.

Modify /etc/quagga/daemons to enable zebra and ospfd.

Create /etc/quagga/zebra.conf files:
interface eth1
 link-detect

interface eth2
 link-detect

Create /etc/quagga/ospfd.conf files:

VM1:
router ospf
  ospf router-id 1.1.1.1
  redistribute kernel
  redistribute connected
  redistribute static
  network 10.1.0.0/24 area 0
  network 10.10.0.0/24 area 0

VM2:
router ospf
  ospf router-id 2.2.2.2
  redistribute kernel
  redistribute connected
  redistribute static 
  network 10.2.0.0/24 area 0
  network 10.10.0.0/24 area 0

Start the daemon on both VMs. Make sure it can see the peer by doing:
vtysh -c 'show ip ospf database'
vtysh -c 'show ip ospf neighbor'

Make sure it sees the other VMs route after a few minutes by doing:
vtysh -c 'show ip ospf route'
netstat -rn

Can also check interface:
vtysh -c 'show ip ospf interface'
