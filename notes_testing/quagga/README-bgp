To test bgp, you need to set up some virtual machines with isolated
networks. In virt-manager/libvirt, set up two "isolated networks" in
addition to the default "NAT" network that is already configured. We will
be setting up the two virtual machines in the following fashion:


                 -------------------------------------   192.168.122.0/24
                     |                           |       (default NAT net)
                     |                           |
                   +---+                       +---+
   10.1.0.0/24  .1 |   |.1    10.10.0.0/24   .2|   |.1    10.2.0.0/24
   ----------------+   +-----------------------+   +-----------------
   isonet1         |   |        isonet2        |   |          isonet1
                   +---+                       +---+
                    vm1                         vm2

Add two addition network interfaces to each vm, one on each isolated
network. Boot up the VMs, and add static networking configuration to their
/etc/network/interfaces files:

VM1:
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 10.1.0.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth2
iface eth2 inet static
address 10.10.0.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

VM2:
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 10.2.0.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth2
iface eth2 inet static
address 10.10.0.2
netmask 255.255.255.0

Reboot them, and make sure they can ping each other's 10.10.0.0/24 address.

Modify /etc/quagga/daemons to enable bgpd.

Create /etc/quagga/zebra.conf files:
interface eth1
 link-detect

interface eth2
 link-detect

Create /etc/quagga/bgpd.conf files:

VM1:
router bgp 2147483676
 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
 network 10.1.0.0/24
 neighbor upstream peer-group
 neighbor upstream remote-as 123456789
 neighbor upstream capability dynamic
 neighbor upstream prefix-list pl-allowed-adv out
 neighbor 10.10.0.2 peer-group upstream
 neighbor 10.10.0.2 description ACME ISP

VM2:
router bgp 123456789
 bgp router-id 2.2.2.2
 network 10.2.0.0/24
 neighbor upstream peer-group
 neighbor upstream remote-as 2147483676
 neighbor upstream capability dynamic
 neighbor upstream prefix-list pl-allowed-adv out
 neighbor 10.10.0.1 peer-group upstream
 neighbor 10.10.0.1 description ACME ISP

Start the daemon on both VMs.

With bgpd running, both sides should see each other as "Established":

# vtysh -c 'show ip bgp neighbor'
BGP neighbor is 10.0.0.233, remote AS 123456789, local AS 2147483676, external link
 Description: ACME ISP
 Member of peer-group upstream for session parameters
  BGP version 4, remote router ID 10.0.0.233
  BGP state = Established, up for 00:00:15
  Last read 00:00:15, hold time is 180, keepalive interval is 60 seconds
....


Older than jaunty bgpd will need AS numbers less than 4 bytes.  Try 12345 and 4836
